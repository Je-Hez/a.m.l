        <li><p>There is nothing more attractive than confidence, once 
            you see your own beauty, so will everyone else.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Confidence is not achieved overnight. It can be achieved 
            by learning from mistakes, it can be achieved by learning from experience.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>The number of ways you can live in one lifetime is limitless. 
            So why limit youself? The sky is not the limit. Beyond the universe is.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>The ultimate aim of an ego is not to see something, but is to 
            be something.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Success comes to those who are honest and confident in their endeavour.</p></li>
        <li><p>All you need is ignorance and confidence and the success is sure to follow. </p></li>
        <li><p>You can cry all you want but it won't help. You have to take action. 
            Take control. Make someone see. Make someone hear you.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Confidence is something you acquire in yourself by believing in self 
            ability with courage and conviction.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>To be a champion you must believe you are the best. If you ain't, 
            pretend you are.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>No one is perfect. Even the most confident people have insecurities. 
            At some point in our lives, we may feel we lack something. That is reality. 
            We must try to live as per our capability. 
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Experience imparts ability on what to do and confidence makes 
            you wise enough on how to do.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Motivation is like fire unless you keep adding fuel to it, it dies. 
            You fuel is your belief in your inner values.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Faith is far more a deliberate action than a confident feeling.</p></li>
        <li><p>Don't burry your talents, the gifts that God has given you! Do not 
            be afraid to dream of great things!
        </p></li>
        <li><p>If you're presenting yourself with confidence, You can pull off 
            pretty much anything.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Don't waste life in fear. When you do something do it with all your 
            might and confidence. Nothing great can be achieved with fear or doubt.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>It is courage and confidence which gives wings to perseverance.</p></li>
        <li><p>Failing is the process of learning, it helps to grow and know 
            who you are. Rise every fall. This process boosts confidence 
            gradually, over the course of your lifetime. Don't stop taking steps 
            forward. Failure is inevitable.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Believe in yourself! Have faith in your abilities! Without a humble 
            but reasonable confidence in your own powers you cannot be successful 
            or happy.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Always follow your dreams. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't 
            do something. Magic is in believing.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Confidence doesn't come when we have ANSWERS it comes only 
            when we are ready to face all the QUESTIONS.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Belief makes the way for confidence, and it is confidence which 
            paves the way for clarity of vision, and clarity of vision experiences 
            the success.
        </p></li>

            yourself.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Any goal can be achieved, if sincere action is incorporated with 
            determination and confidence.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>When there is nothing left to say, lift your head up high, smile, 
            and walk away like you own the world.

    <ol>
        <li><p>Watch your thoughts, they become your words. Watch your words, 
            they become your actions. Watch your actions, they become your 
            destiny! 
        </p></li>
        <li><p>I think that, as life is action and passion, it is required of man 
            that he should share the passion and action of his time at peril 
            of being judged not to have lived.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Actions speak louder than words, so trust actions 
            and not words.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>The great end of life is not knowledge but action.</p></li>
        <li><p>In life, you prove your worth through your actions, 
            not your words.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Characterize people by their actions and you will never 
            be fooled by their words.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Sometimes it doesn't matter how right you are... 
            sometimes just shutting up is the best course of action.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Positive results will come when you start to replace your negative 
            thoughts and habits with positive ones.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Action without thought is like shooting 
            without aim.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>When words fail... Action Speaks... When action fails... 
            Eyes speak... When eyes Fail... Tears speak... And when everything else fails... 
            'Silence' speaks
        </p></li>
        <li><p>When it is obvious that the goals cannot be reach, don't adjust 
            the goals; adjust the action steps.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Age doesn't make you MATURE. It is the actions and behaviours that you 
            display during adverse situations that do.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>You need to understand life enough and at the same time be 
            ready to endure the consequences of your actions, because every action 
            of life comes with a reward.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Your life ain't decided by fate; you must create the future 
            you want by taking the right actions now.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Actions prove who someone is, words just prove who they 
            wanna be.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Let your dreams be bigger than your fears and your actions be louder 
            than your words.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>If you wanna know your past, look into your present conditions. 
            If you wanna know your future, look into your present actions.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Your words are useless without actions.</p></li>
        <li><p>Determine today what is important and follow through with action...</p></li>
        <li><p>Your choice. Your actions. Your life. Live it your way with no 
            regrets.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>You're responsible for your own choices and your own actions. 
            It's your life. Learn from your mistakes and never regret.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't be nervous. Take the thought of 
            your mind and put it into action. You will be amazed when you simply try.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>You must either be content of your life as it is or take action 
            to change it.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Commitment leads to action. Actions bring your dreams closer.</p></li>
        <li><p>It is difficult to steer a parking car, so get moving.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stop waiting for the perfect moment, take the moment you have and make it perfect.</p></li>
        <li><p>Never act on impulse. Plan first. Think it through. Then act.</p></li>
        <li><p>In order to carry a positive action we must develop here a positive vision.</p></li>
        <li><p>Do it because you wanna, not just because you've gotta. When you do what 
            you want, you create Unstoppable POWER.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>You won't have time, do it now!</p></li>
        <li><p>Until you take action to be, what you desire to be, you continue to be, 
            what you are.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Action is the foundational key to success.</p></li>
        <li><p>Your only limitation is how much action you are willing to take.</p></li>
        <li><p>Don't wait until the conditions are pefect to begin. Beginnning makes the conditions perfect.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Success loves preparation, effort and action.</p></li>
        <li><p>Don't wait for an opportunity, create one.</p></li>
        <li><p>Dreams are motivation but only a few will go and get it.</p></li>
        <li><p>Don't wait for an opportunity to come to you instead create opportunity by 
            yourself.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Focused action and continuous efforts are the key to getting what 
            you really want in life.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Stop waiting for things to get better and do something to make it better.</p></li>
        <li><p>You may never know what results come from your action. But if you do 
            nothing, there will be no result.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Things will not happen by themselves, we have to make it happen.</p></li>
        <li><p>Some people dream of success, others make it happen.</p></li>
        <li><p>To make mark in this life, you must be resolute and courageous enough 
            to take action on your dreams.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Leadership is not position. It consists of action with transparency 
            and to set high example of integrity, honesty and to strive for welfare of all.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Act with determination not to be turned aside by thoughts of the past and fears 
            of the future.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Life is never worth worrying about deeds. Just doing is enough to get better.</p></li>
        <li><p>Ideas are meaningless without action. Everyone has ideas. To succeed, make your ideas 
            real. Make them happen.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Opportunities are like sunrises. If you wait too long, you miss them.</p></li>

        <li><p>A person should set his goals as early as he can and devote all his 
            energy and talent to getting there. With enough effort, he may achieve it. 
            Or he may find something that is even more rewarding. But in the end, 
            no matter what the outcome, he will know he has been alive.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Our goals can only be reached through a vehicle of a plan, in which 
            we must vigorously act. There is no other route to success.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>All who have accomplished great things have had a great aim, 
            have fixed their gaze on a goal which was high, one which sometimes 
            seemed impossible.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>A goal without plan is just a wish.</p></li>
        <li><p>Goals provide the energy source that powers our lives. 
            One of the best ways we can get the most from the energy we have is to 
            focus it. That is what goals can do for us; concentrate our energy.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>You must take action now that will move you towards your goals. Develop a sense 
            of urgency in your life.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>If you've got no goals, you will always work for someone who does</p></li>
        <li><p>Difficulties increase the nearer we approach the goal.</p></li>
        <li><p>Whenever you make a mistake or get knocked down by life, 
            don't look back at it too long. Mistakes are life's way 
            of teaching you. Your capacity for occasional blunders 
            is inseparable from your capactiy to reach your goals. 
            No one wins them all, and your failures, when they happen, 
            are just part of your growth. Shake off your blunders. 
            How will you know your limits without an occasional failure? 
            Never quit. Your turn will come.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Crystallize your goals. Make a plan for achieving them 
            and set yourself a deadline. Then, with supreme confidence, 
            determination and disregard for obstacles and other people's 
            criticisms, carry out your plan.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Reach high, for the stars lie hidden in your soul. 
            Dream deep, for every dream precedes the goal.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>If you want a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to 
            people or things.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>You control your future, your destiny. What you think 
            about comes about. By recording your dreams and goals 
            on paper, you set in motion the process of becoming the 
            person you most want to be. Put your future in good hands; Your own.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Think before you speak. Plan before you act. Accomplish 
            your goals before it's too late.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Dreaming is wonderful, goal setting is crucial, but action 
            is supreme. To make something great happen you must get 
            busy and make it happen.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>The more reasons you have for achieving your goal, the 
            more determined you will become.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Good things don't come to those who wait. Good things come to those 
            who pursue the goals and dreams they believe in
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Always stay true to yourself no matter what, and never let what anybody 
            says distract you from your goals.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Decide whether or not the goal is worth the risks involved. If it is, 
            stop worrying.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Do something to move yourself toward your major goal every day.</p></li>
        <li><p>Don't even think about quitting. You are always closer to 
            your goals than you think. There's no reason to backtrack now. 
            It makes nosense.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Whatever your goal is, don't give up on it, perseverance will lead 
            to your ultimate achievements.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Whenever you feel like giving up, remember why you set this goal 
            in the first place.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>If we feed the seed of unselfish goal in our life with prominence, 
            do our deeds with persistence, proceed with perseverance, accede patience; 
            then we surely reap the result of a profound success with an excellence.
